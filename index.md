Hi,

My name is Bulent. I develop software since 2011.
I am a senior android developer. I am also a junior backend developer for my side projects.

I worked for startups and enterprise companies. 
Currently, I work at Akbank, one of the largest banks in Turkey. Kotlin and Java are the main languages that I use.
I also have some experience in Go, JavaScript, Spring Framework.
You can check out my projects [here](/projects).

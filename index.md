Hi,

My name is Bulent. I develop software since 2011.
I am senior at android development but kinda junior at backend development :)

I worked for startups and enterprise companies. 
Currently, I work at a banking company named Akbank which is one of the biggest in Turkey.
Kotlin and Java are my main languages that I often use.
But I have also some experience in Go, JavaScript, Spring Framework.
You can find my projects on [Projects](/projects) tab.

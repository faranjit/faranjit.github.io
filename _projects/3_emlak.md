It was very old application written with Java when I start to work on. I renewed login and pre login screens with Kotlin, updated old dependencies, migrated from gcm to fcm, integrated new user verification library. Also I set up Jenkins to build test apps for android and ios and I wrote a Python script to upload apk and ipa files to AppCenter to distribute them to testers.

Some libraries and tools that I use are listed below:
  * Retrofit
  * Dagger 2
  * Glide
  * Coroutines
  * Android Architecture Components
  * Android Jetpack Libraries

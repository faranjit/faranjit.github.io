[Nonnatech](https://app.nonnatech.com/){:target="_blank"} is one of the only platforms able to successfully integrate many different devices to provide real-time monitoring and automatic data transfer to clinicians, family members, and home care staff that can be passively collected.

There is a dashboard for clinicians to track data of patients gathered from sensors. Dashboard apis are developing with Go. There is also another Go project that is for parsing raw sensor data and inserting to db.

This application has been developed since 2013. The tech stack and ui have been renewed since 2018. First it was fully developed with Java and then it is migrated to Kotlin. Also there are some React Native parts.

In the beginning of the migration we decided to use MVVM pattern to apply Clean Architecture principles. Some libraries and tools that we use are:
  * Retrofit
  * Dagger 2
  * Glide
  * RxJava
  * Android Architecture Components
  * Android Jetpack Libraries
  * Room
  * Gson

My main responsibilites are developing register and login, user verification, dashboard, account applications, KYC(Know Your Customer) and integrating third party libraries.

Google play link is [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akbank.android.apps.akbank_direkt){:target="_blank"}.

This application has been developing since 2013. It has been renewed with all tech stack and ui since 2018. First it was fully developed with Java and then it is migrated to Kotlin. Also there are some React Native parts.

Before start renewing the app we decided to use MVVM pattern to apply Clean Architecture principles. Some libraries and tools that we use are listed below:
  * Retrofit
  * Dagger 2
  * Glide
  * RxJava
  * Android Architecture Components
  * Android Jetpack Libraries
  * Room

My main responsibilites are developing register and login, user verification, dashboard, account applications, KYC(Know Your Customer) and integrating third party libraries.

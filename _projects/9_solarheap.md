[Solarheap](http://solarheap.com/){:target="_blank"} was a startup in solar energy area. The main purpose is meeting investors for solar projects.

The site had these main features:
  * Project owners login
  * Investors' login
  * Create project
  * List projects

The site was developed with MEAN Stack(MongoDb, Express framework, AngularJS, Node.js). First it was deployed on Azure. I moved it to Aws.
